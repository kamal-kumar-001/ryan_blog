## Example for SOCKS 'connect' command

The connect command is the most common use-case for a SOCKS proxy. This establishes a direct connection to a destination host through a proxy server. The destination host only has knowledge of the proxy server connecting to it and does not know about the origin client (you).

**Origin Client (you) <-> Proxy Server <-> Destination Server**

In this example, we are connecting to a web server on port 80, and sending a very basic HTTP request to receive a response. It's worth noting that there are many socks-http-agents that can be used with the node http module (and libraries such as request.js) to make this easier. This HTTP request is used as a simple example.

The 'connect' command can be used via the SocksClient.createConnection() factory function as well as by creating a SocksClient instance and using event handlers.

### Using createConnection with async/await

Since SocksClient.createConnection returns a Promise, we can easily use async/await for flow control.

```typescript
const SocksClient = require('socks').SocksClient;

const options  = {
  proxy: {
    host: '104.131.124.203',
    port: 1081,
    type: 5
  },

  destination: {
    host: 'ip-api.com', // host names are supported with SOCKS v4a and SOCKS v5.
    port: 80
  },

  command: 'connect'
};

async function start() {
  try {
    const info = await SocksClient.createConnection(options);

    console.log(info.socket);
    // <Socket ...>  (this is a raw net.Socket that is established to the destination host through the given proxy servers)

    info.socket.write('GET /json HTTP/1.1\nHost: ip-api.com\n\n');
    info.socket.on('data', (data) => {
      console.log(data.toString()); // ip-api.com sees that the last proxy (104.131.124.203) is connected to it and not the origin client (you).
